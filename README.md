# CSS Transitions Demo

## Background

The intention of this project is to provide demonstrations of `CSS` (and `Javascript` in a supporting role) used to create dynamic, intuitive, and effective transitions between different elements of a basic website/app, as well as corresponding code snippets. The goal is to demystify `CSS` transitions and animations. A future goal might be to compare these effects to their implimentation with Javascript in a leading role supported by minimal `CSS`.

The structure of the frontend will be a very basic website on which the effects can be demonstrated:
* A `menu` of the effects
* An `aside` of options relevent to the effects
* A `main` of code snippets

## MVPs
- [ ] 3 `menu` effects (either altering the `menu` display based on user interaction or hiding/displaying the `menu`)
- [ ] 3 `main` content effects (transitioning between content in the `body` based on menu selection)
- [ ] Explanation/Details about each effect
- [ ] Code snippets for each effect

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This project will be built primarily with vanilla `Javascript`,`CSS`, and `HTML5`, with help of a bundler (most likely `Webpack`)

In addition to the entry file, the `Javascript` will be proken up into separate files for each of the 6 effects, a file for rendering the basic page elements, and a util file for universally useful functions.

## Implementation Timeline
- Day 1: Set up basic structure for project and entry file, as well as basics for additional files. Build out demo skeleton, including snippet component. Research CSS Animation/Transitions and settle on 6 effects to accomplish. 
- Day 2, 3, 4: 2 effects added, tested, and bug free. 
- Day 5: Final styling for overall page, refactor code (with special attention to snippets).
